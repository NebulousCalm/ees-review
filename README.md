# EES Year in Review

> This was a project designed as a final for Highschool Earth and Environmental Science (honors). This project was designed with Jetbrains IDE Webstorm. Written in NextJS, I struggled quite a bit. I'm a python backend developer I was a bit out of my element here but I think it turned out alright. I utilized a few libraries (typewritter-effect && fontawesome)

PACKAGE MANAGER REQUIREMENTS

```cmd
npm install typewriter-effect
npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
npm i --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@latest
```
If you want to run locally, use the `./app` directory and use `npm run dev`. Go to the localhost port it provides on your machine
